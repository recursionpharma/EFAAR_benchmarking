## Development

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or later

* Pip for installing Python dependencies

* A virtual environment tool such as `pyenv` or `conda`

### Installing

1. Clone the project to your machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Setup the virtual environment and activate it.

4. Install the dependencies via `pip install -e .`

### Making and Submitting Changes

* Before making any changes, ensure you have the latest version of the project by pulling the changes from trunk.

* Create a new branch for your changes. This could be for adding functionality or addressing a bug.

* While developing, make sure to to add a docstring to all new functions, that clearly yet briefly explains what the function does, what the inputs and outputs are, and what exceptions the function can raise.

* Update the `pyproject.toml` file with any new requirements. This ensures that others setting up the project environment will have all necessary dependencies installed.

* Make sure your changes are atomic (i.e., each commit should contain a single logical change), and the commit message clearly describes this change. This makes the commit history much easier to understand.

* If you use a new benchmark source to evaluate maps, make sure to add it to `benchmark_annotations` folder with license information added to the LICENSE file for benchmark annotations [here](https://github.com/recursionpharma/EFAAR_benchmarking/blob/trunk/efaar_benchmarking/benchmark_annotations/LICENSE).

* If you are adding functions for a new perturbative map build, make sure you add a notebook to enable others so they can reproduce your results.

## Submitting Changes

* Make sure to run `pre-commit run --all-files` to find and fix simple issues before submission.

* Stage and commit your changes: `git add <modified files>` and `git commit -m "your message"`. Your commit message should be a brief description of what changes were made.

* Push your branch: `git push origin <branch-name>`.

* In the Github repository, create a new Pull Request.

* Describe your changes in the Pull Request and link any related issues.

* Wait for the review and make any necessary changes.

* After approval, your changes will be merged. Congratulations!
